# Basic-JavaScriptFiles
The earliest code of my JavaScript journey.  I am a recent college graduate who majored in theoretical mathematics and minored in CS, and wants to work in 
the CS industry.  So I am adding some certifications and such to back up my bachelors degree.

This set of simple javaScript files is a record of my programming experience with js.  I am only going to add files that may have some use in the future or the 
idea of the program is good and has potential to be something better in the future.
